This is the TOP foundation's project, where i needed to create a simple rock paper scissors game with a browser. 

(4.02.21) I made a function where the browser creates a random choice - rock, paper or scissors.
Then this function is being used for another function where the player plays a round of rock paper scissor. After that
I created a game function that plays 5 rounds of the game, keeps score of it and comments on the outcome either the player
wins, loses or there is a draw.
