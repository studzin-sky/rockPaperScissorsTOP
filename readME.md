This is the TOP foundation's project, where i needed to create a simple rock paper scissors game with a browser. 

4.02.21
I made a function where the browser creates a random choice - rock, paper or scissors.
Then this function is being used for another function where the player plays a round of rock paper scissor. After that
I created a game function that plays 5 rounds of the game, keeps score of it and comments on the outcome either the player
wins, loses or there is a draw.

Another assignment from TOP is to add a simple UI for the player to pick one of the options to play the game rather than typing and answer into the insert popup. 

17.02.21 
Created functions that works with DOM for a players choice, then a function that takes the choice and plays the game with the browser, then the outcome is being printed on the page with a comment of the win/lose or draw. 

4.03.21 
I finished the whole script of the game. 
It took me a little longer than expected, but finally I managed to finish all of the code. I learned how to declare a function that adds value to the variable.
Then I learned how to direct the events in JS. 
I tried to write everything by myself, with a little help from google. Looking forward for the next TOP assignment.
